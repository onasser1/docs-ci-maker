This file is added through a Merge Request before using rules in GitLab CI/CD configuration files. (.gitlab-ci.yml).

All pipeline stages would run even if it's only a pipeline, we don't need to redeploy the website again from just a merge request, but it will do because of not using rules.

After that we intend to use rules to only run deploy stage when it's merged to the default branch (master) or a change is made to the website directory only for example.
